# LF
This repository contains the R code and documentation for the development of spatial predictive model for [Lymphatic Filariasis](http://www.who.int/lymphatic_filariasis/disease/en/) when two different diagnostics are used.

## To do
- [ ] Read LF papers
- [ ] Create R functions for the two models
- [ ] Finish to test the models
- [ ] Generate predictions for the entire continent

## Notes
- There is a concern in low-density microfilaraemia in sutaining parasite transmission in communities during and following control programmes ([Snow et al., 2006](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00629.x/abstract)). This is because MDA does not always clear microfilariae (mf) from the peripheral blood, levaing a small number of people with very low levels of infection ([(Mahoney & Kessel, 1971](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2427888/pdf/bullwho00194-0047.pdf); [Bryan & Southgate, 1976](http://www.aaojournal.org/article/0035-9203(76)90005-5/pdf)).
